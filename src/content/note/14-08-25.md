Tracing crossplane creation and errors can be done by tracing your custom resource. But you might have to trace errors in the underlying provider resources as well.  
```shell
crossplane beta trace my-custom-resource-type my-custom-resource-name
crossplane beta trace bucketpolicy.s3.aws.upbound.io my-custom-resource-name
# Need kubectl to find more verbose messages about 
kubectl get bucketpolicy.s3.aws.upbound.io my-custom-resource-name -oyaml
```
